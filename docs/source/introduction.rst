Introduction
============

Hermpy (Hermean Python) is a Python package with the aim of making all aspects of data science simpler at Mercury. This includes the downloading and handling of data, but also plotting routines and other useful functions.

Hermpy was developed at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies by D. M. Hollman, C. F. Bowers, C. M. Jackman, and M. J. Rutala. It was devloped and tested using **Python 3.12**, on a Linux operating system.


Motivation
**********

The rapidly growing field of space physics lacks generalised tools with which to make the process of data visualisation both quick and easy for researchers. We create hermpy as both a useful tool, but also an example for how similar tools could be created inthe future for other areas of space science.
